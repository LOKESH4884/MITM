man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) occurs when an attacker intercepts and possibly manipulates the communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly. This deceptive intervention requires the attacker to position themselves within the same network as the intended victims to successfully deceive both parties involved in the communication.
Bettercap is a powerful tool used in Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks and network penetration testing. It's designed to intercept, manipulate, and analyze network traffic between two or more devices on the same network. Here are some of its capabilities:

1.Packet Sniffing: Bettercap can capture network packets flowing between devices within the same network. This allows an attacker to intercept sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other data transmitted over the network.

2.Session Hijacking: With Bettercap, an attacker can hijack active sessions between two devices, allowing them to impersonate one or both parties involved in the communication. This enables the attacker to perform various malicious activities, such as injecting malicious code or stealing sensitive information.

3.SSL/TLS Stripping: Bettercap can strip SSL/TLS encryption from network traffic, allowing the attacker to view plaintext data exchanged between the victim devices. This is particularly effective against websites that do not enforce HTTPS or have weak SSL/TLS configurations.

4.ARP Spoofing: Bettercap can perform ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing attacks, where it impersonates the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept and redirect traffic intended for the targeted device to their own machine.

5.DNS Spoofing: Bettercap can spoof DNS (Domain Name System) responses, redirecting users to malicious websites or phishing pages. This can be used to trick users into entering their login credentials or downloading malware.

6.Module System: Bettercap's modular architecture allows for the easy development and integration of new features and plugins, expanding its capabilities beyond the default set of tools.

Bettercap provides attackers with a comprehensive set of tools to conduct sophisticated MITM attacks and network reconnaissance, making it a popular choice among security professionals and hackers alike. However, it's important to note that using Bettercap for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. It should only be used for legitimate security testing and research purposes with proper authorization.
